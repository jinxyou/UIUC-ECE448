    "\n",
    "Since the file is called `submitted.py`, python considers it to contain a module called `submitted`.  As shown, you can read the module's docstring by printing `submitted.__doc__`.  You can also type `help(submitted)` to get a lot of information about the module, including its docstring, a list of all the functions it defines, and all of their docstrings.
